description: This is the description of the Istanbul 2023 post
summary: Istanbul previously known as Constantinople, a city so rich and strategic even the Romans were eager to claim as the new Rome. It is at the center of many junctions. Connecting Asia and Europe through land and sea. A city where the east and west harmoniously converge and diverge. There is no color, taste, or sight that you will not experience in Istanbul. Truly the crown jewel of Turkey and the epicenter of the present now.

## Home Away From Home
---
Turkey is a soup of cultures that have moved through and settled in since
ancient times. There are no ethnic minorities nor a predominant majority, people
here are of all colors, races, and religions. Mosques next to Churches and
Kebabs served next to noodles. I never felt estranged in Istanbul; on the
contrary, I always felt relevant and right at home. Being a middle eastern
Muslim myself, I'm always one step away from all the familiar tastes and
dialects. Mosques are everywhere, and each with its own unique history,
architecture  and backstory.

## Constantinople

As you walk down the streets of Istanbul, you can feel the overwhelming depth of
history. Watching as building stones change shape, texture and color, you will
realize a lot have happened here. Some of these stones and buildings have been
there for hundreds or even thousands of years. Constantinople - modern day
Istanbul - is an ancient city. Its location is very strategic as it's located at
the frontsteps of Europe. It's also a gateway connecting two continents, two
seas and making possible air, land and sea trades across Africa, Asia and
Europe. No wonder why Romans wanted to claim it and crown it as the new Rome!

When it comes to food, the streets of Istanbul are flooded with different local
and international cuisines. The varieties can be overwhelming at first, but I
have not regret any of the choices I've made. Starting with the local foods,
Kebab is king in Turkey. The meat is mixed with spices then barbecued either
sliced or minced and wrapped over skewers. You never go wrong when you ask for
Kebabs in Istanbul.
