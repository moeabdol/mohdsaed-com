description: This is the description of the Istanbul 2023 post
summary: Istanbul previously known as Constantinople, a city so rich and strategic even the Romans were eager to claim it as a new capital replacing old Rome. It is at the center of many conjectures. Connecting Asia and Europe through land and sea. A city where the east and west harmoniously converge and diverge. There is no color, taste, or sight that you will not experience in Istanbul. Truely the crown jewel of all cities and the epicenter of the present now.

## Home Away From Home

Turkey is a soup of cultures that have moved through or settled in the region
since ancient times. There are no minorities nor a predominant majority, people
here are of all colors, ethnicities, and religions. Mosques next to Churches and
Kebabs served with noodles. I never felt estranged in Istanbul; on the contrary,
I always felt relevant and right at home. Being a middle eastern muslim myself,
I'm one step away from all the familiar tastes and sounds. Mosques are
everywhere, and each with its own unique history and backstory.

As you walk down the streets of Istanbul, you can feel the tremendous history.
Watching as building stones change shape, texture and color, you will realize
that a lot have happened here. Some of these stones and buildings have been
there for hundreds or even thousands of years. Constantinople - modern day
Istanbul - is an ancient city. Its location is very strategic as it's located at
the frontsteps of Europe. It's also a gateway connecting two continents, two
seas and making possible air, land and sea trades across Africa, Asia and
Europe. No wonder why Romans wanted to calim it and crown it as the new Rome!
