## First Encounter

I first encountered the Kinesis back in 2012. Back then I was studying for my
master's degree in Tokyo, Japan. During my lab hours, I sat next to **Haru** a
PhD student working on advanced game algorithms. He had an Arch Linux box
running without a mouse and without any GUI whatsoever! On the other hand, I was
proudly rocking my 2010 Apple MacBook Pro stuffed with applications from the App
Store. I was a hardcore Apple fanboy then, but I always kept peeking across at
Haru's setup and thinking to myself this is why?!

Haru rarely spoke, as he knew very little English, and I very little Japanese.
Whenever we communicated, it turned into a hilarious debate spoken in either
infant level English or Japanese. None the less, we enjoyed each other's company
and shared a silent, mutual respect knowing we are all nerds with different
toys. Haru never seized to amaze! He did everything from within the terminal.
From writing code to surfing the Internet to sending emails and more. It was
always enjoyable watching him do the things he did as his quick fingers rubbed
naturally against the keyboard without ever leaving the home row.

What struck me first about the Kinesis was its design. Most notably, the concave
key-wells. I remember thinking to myself, this must be custom made for aesthetic
purposes, but then I examined the layout and it had both the traditional Qwerty
and Dvorak layouts printed on its key caps. I didn't understand the reasoning
behind the design, and thought if I got used to that I might end up forgetting
how to type on a regular keyboard. Little did I know that traditional keyboards
were designed after the original typewriters of the 1800s. And that original
layout design - although great at the time - remained almost unchanged until
now!
